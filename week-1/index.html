    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <p> Hi, as the title says, my name is Matt Gerard.
        I came from Massachusetts to study at NEIT and I'm majoring in Game Development.
        That's because ever since I was young I've loved video games and everything about them.
        From the great stories to the fun mechanics to even the music, I just can't get enough.
        I always wondered if I had what it takes to make my own video games someday. 
        Once I entered High School I chose programming as my elective to see if creating games was really for me and needless to say, it was.
        My favorite game franchises are Pokémon, The Legend of Zelda, and Five Nights at Freddys.
        My favorite game however, has to be Celeste.
        This game is challenging but fair while also being fun, the controls are responsive and tight, and also the game’s story and soundtrack are incredible.
    </p>
    <p> Okay I think I rambled on a bit too much about video games, so here's some fun info about me.
        I'm a bit of an artist, I like to draw cool characters and concepts from time to time.
        I have two brothers back at home, one younger by a year and an older by about 4 years.
        The one country I would like to visit the most is Japan.
        My favorite animal is the fox because it kinda looks like a combination of a cat and dog.
        To wrap this up, One final fact about myself is that my favorite gaming console is the Nintendo Switch.
